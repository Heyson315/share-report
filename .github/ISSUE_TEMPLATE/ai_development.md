## 🧠 AI Development Enhancement

> 📚 **Before filing**: Review existing AI development guides:
> - [AI Agent Quick Start](.github/AI_AGENT_QUICKSTART.md)
> - [AI Workflow Testing](.github/AI_WORKFLOW_TESTING.md)
> - [MCP Tool Patterns](.github/MCP_TOOL_PATTERNS.md)
> - [Copilot Instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md)

**Type of AI Enhancement**
- [ ] Copilot instructions improvement
- [ ] MCP server functionality
- [ ] AI agent workflow optimization
- [ ] Code pattern documentation
- [ ] Testing automation for AI workflows
- [ ] Documentation improvements

**Current AI Agent Experience**
Describe how AI agents currently interact with this area of the codebase.

Example: "When adding a new Python script, AI agents need to manually look up the standard file structure and testing patterns."

**Proposed Enhancement**
Clear description of how to improve the AI development experience.

Example: "Add a 'New Script Template' section to AI_AGENT_QUICKSTART.md with copy-paste ready template."

**Which Guide(s) Should Be Updated?**
- [ ] `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Master architecture and patterns reference
- [ ] `.github/AI_AGENT_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick onboarding and common tasks
- [ ] `.github/AI_WORKFLOW_TESTING.md` - Testing patterns and automation
- [ ] `.github/MCP_TOOL_PATTERNS.md` - MCP tool development
- [ ] Other (specify): _______
- [ ] No changes needed

**Impact Assessment**
- [ ] Requires updates to copilot instructions
- [ ] New patterns to document
- [ ] Architecture changes to explain
- [ ] MCP server functionality affected
- [ ] New MCP tools needed
- [ ] Authentication/security implications
- [ ] Testing strategy updates
- [ ] Documentation structure changes

**MCP Integration Considerations**
- [ ] Affects MCP server functionality
- [ ] New MCP tools needed
- [ ] Authentication/security implications
- [ ] Tool registration changes
- [ ] Not applicable

**Testing Strategy**
How will this enhancement be validated with AI agents?

Example: 
- [ ] AI agent successfully completes task using new pattern
- [ ] Tests pass with new testing pattern
- [ ] MCP tool works as documented
- [ ] Documentation is clear and actionable

**Success Criteria**
What does success look like for this enhancement?

Example:
- AI agents can add a new Python script in <5 minutes
- 90% reduction in common mistakes
- Clear examples provided for all patterns

**References**
- Related to existing guide section: _______
- Related documentation: _______
- External AI development resources: _______
- Similar patterns in other projects: _______

**Additional Context**
