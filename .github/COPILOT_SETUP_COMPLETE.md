✅ `AI_DEVELOPMENT_INDEX.md` - Complete navigation hub  
✅ `AI_WORKFLOW_TESTING.md` - Testing strategies  
✅ `MCP_TOOL_PATTERNS.md` - MCP tool development  
✅ `WEB_DESIGN_GUIDE.md` - Web design patterns  

## Validation
A comprehensive validation report has been created at:
`.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_VALIDATION.md`

This report includes:
- Complete best practices checklist (10 categories)
- Link verification results (5 links verified)
- Document statistics and structure analysis
- GitHub best practices compliance matrix
- Recommendations for future maintenance
