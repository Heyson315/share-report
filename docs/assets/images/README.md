# Placeholder for website images

Add the following images to this directory:
- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- og-image.png (1200x630 for Open Graph)
- twitter-card.png (1200x600 for Twitter Card)
- logo.png
- screenshots/ (directory for feature screenshots)

Until real images are added, the site will work without them (browsers will show default favicon).
