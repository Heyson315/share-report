| Version | Supported          | Notes |

| Feature branches | :white_check_mark: | Pre-release features under review |

## Build Provenance Attestation

All artifacts generated by GitHub Actions workflows are cryptographically signed using GitHub's build provenance attestation. This provides:

- **Supply Chain Security**: Verifiable proof that artifacts were built by GitHub Actions
- **Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic signatures prevent tampering
- **Audit Trail**: Complete provenance metadata for compliance requirements

### Verifying Artifact Attestations

To verify the provenance of an artifact:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# gh auth login

# Download and verify an artifact
gh attestation verify <artifact-path> --owner Heyson315 --repo Easy-Ai
```

All security reports, audit results, and build artifacts include attestations automatically.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the M365 Security Toolkit:

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [security contact information]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: Every 5 business days
- **Resolution Target**: Critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days

### Security Best Practices

When using this toolkit:

1. **Credentials**: Never commit secrets to the repository
2. **Service Principals**: Use least-privilege permissions
3. **Audit Logs**: Review workflow logs regularly
4. **Dependencies**: Keep Python and PowerShell modules updated
5. **Attestations**: Verify artifact provenance before deployment

## Security Features
