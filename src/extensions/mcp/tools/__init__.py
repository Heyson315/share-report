MCP Tools Package

Individual tool definitions for the M365 Security MCP Server.
Tools are organized by functionality for better maintainability.

Current organization:
- audit_tools.py: Security audit and CIS compliance tools
- sharepoint_tools.py: SharePoint analysis and permissions tools
- compliance_tools.py: Compliance reporting and status tools

Future: Can be split from server.py for better modularity.
